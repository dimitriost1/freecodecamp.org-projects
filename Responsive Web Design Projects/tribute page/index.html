        "In general, father Paisiosâ€™ figure and my contact with him, along with some other deified persons God blessed 
        me to meet in my life, was and is a very important presence in my life. He was a man illumined by God,
         an ascetic-anchorite of the 4th century who lived in our century. At the same time he was a father and a 
         brother, with discernment, prudence and humour. He would say high truths in a very smart and cute way and give 
         simple examples with very deep content. He did not pretend to be a teacher or a monk, though he was a true 
         teacher and a real monk, a true man, man of God, who taught with prayer, 
        silence, humour, love, self-reproach and with discerning and clever advice, without insulting anyone."
